# Energiz"house
 This project is designed to raise awareness about water and electricity consumption within households. It aims not only to inform and engage adults but also to educate children through accessible, interactive, and age-appropriate features. By promoting responsible usage habits and providing real-time insights into daily consumption, the project encourages families to adopt more sustainable behaviors together. Whether you're a parent, a child, or simply someone who wants to reduce their environmental footprint, this tool empowers every member of the household to make a difference
